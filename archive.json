That specific part of RFC 2026 suggest the appeal process being established appears to me to boil down to:\r\n\r\n* the appeal goes to the IESG, and there's no escalation available past that\r\n* the appeal must provide adequate detail\r\n* the appeal must be filed within two months of the DE's decision\r\n* the IESG has discretion to process the appeal however it wants\r\n* the IESG has to complete its review and deliver its decision in a reasonable amount of time\r\n\r\n...or at least that's how I read it.  Maybe I'm being too pedantic but I also note that RFC 2026 Section 6.5.4 is subordinate to Section 6.5, which says that it (and its subsections) apply to decisions that are made as part of the standards process using consensus development, and decisions of a DE do not meet that definition.  It doesn't look to me like 6.5.4 was meant to be referenced or incorporated in this way.\r\n\r\nI suggest this is something the WG should review and decide whether it wants to keep this as-is or perhaps say something more explicit and crisp.\r\n\r\n",

I would suggest that one add a column in the media types registry for each entry to indicate those that have RTP payload formats. \n2. Secondly there is the question if one like to convert the implicit indicator in the encoding information, that some but not all framed encodings are RTP, and rather have an explicit field in the registration template to say: Media Type has an RTP payload format.

Example: a top-level type of 'oid', leading to types of the form oid/nnnnn, where nnn is an OID (Object Identifier) designating a specific media format,\n\n* A top-level type MUST NOT be defined for the mapping of other protocol elements to media types. For example, while there may be some merit to a mapping from media types to URIs, e.g. in the context of RDF (Resource Description Framework), there is very limited merit in a reverse mapping, and even less merit in creating a top-level type for such a mapping. The same applies to other protocol elements such as file extensions or URI schemes. The recommended solution in case a mapping is needed is to choose a single type/subtype and put the additional information in an appropriately named parameter. As an example, information on a file extension '.dcat' can be encoded as 'application/octet-string; filename=foo.dcat'.\n\n* Media types are not a general type system. A top-level type MUST NOT be defined if its main or only purpose is to map other type systems, e.g. in programming languages or ontologies.\n\n* A new top-level type SHOULD NOT generate aliases for existing widely used types or subtypes.\n\nThere has to be a more efficient and friendly way to convey this; using bullet points implies that they're four different things, and they're not.",

For example, while there may be some merit to a mapping from media types to URIs, e.g. in the context of RDF (Resource Description Framework), there is very limited merit in a reverse mapping, and even less merit in creating a top-level type for such a mapping. The same applies to other protocol elements such as file extensions or URI schemes. The recommended solution in case a mapping is needed is to choose a single type/subtype and put the additional information in an appropriately named parameter. As an example, information on a file extension '.dcat' can be encoded as 'application/octet-string; filename=foo.dcat'.\r\n```",
