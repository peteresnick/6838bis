That specific part of RFC 2026 suggest the appeal process being established appears to me to boil down to:\r\n\r\n* the appeal goes to the IESG, and there's no escalation available past that\r\n* the appeal must provide adequate detail\r\n* the appeal must be filed within two months of the DE's decision\r\n* the IESG has discretion to process the appeal however it wants\r\n* the IESG has to complete its review and deliver its decision in a reasonable amount of time\r\n\r\n...or at least that's how I read it.  Maybe I'm being too pedantic but I also note that RFC 2026 Section 6.5.4 is subordinate to Section 6.5, which says that it (and its subsections) apply to decisions that are made as part of the standards process using consensus development, and decisions of a DE do not meet that definition.  It doesn't look to me like 6.5.4 was meant to be referenced or incorporated in this way.\r\n\r\nI suggest this is something the WG should review and decide whether it wants to keep this as-is or perhaps say something more explicit and crisp.\r\n\r\n",
